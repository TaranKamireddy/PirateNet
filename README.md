# PirateNet

This is the code for the Academies Hackathon project we created, PirateNet. To run the code, download both the input and output files in pickle format, and then run PirateNetModel.py.

Unfortunately my input files and sonar images file are too large to upload. Here is a google drive link to the input files and a small portion of the sonar images:
